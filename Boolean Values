#Boolean Values Basics

#Boolean data type only has two possible data types, True and False. 

bValue = True
bValue  
#evaluates to True
true
#returns an error since true is lowercase, it is not the boolean value of true, so Python thinks it is a variable, and we have not defined a variable named true. 

True = 2 + 2
#returns error since True is a boolean data type and cannot be assigned as a variable.
